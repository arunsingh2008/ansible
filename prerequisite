The following table contains a few different examples of common patterns you can use when running commands and playbooks with Ansible:

Pattern	          Result Target
all	              All Hosts from your inventory file
host1	            A single host (host1)
host1:host2	      Both host1 and host2
group1	          A single group (group1)
group1:group2	    All servers in group1 and group2
group1:\&group2	  Only servers that are both in group1 and group2
group1:\!group2	  Servers in group1 except those also in group2
